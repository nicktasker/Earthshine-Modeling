# Modeling Signal from an Earth-like Exoplanet Using the Earthshine

I work with Dr. Theodora Karalidi, a post-dosctoral researcher at UC Santa Cruz and an expert in brown dwarf and exoplanet atmospheres.
This repo houses the Python code which I use to generate plots and ASCII tables from NASA MODIS data for use in modeling an Earth-like exoplanet. This is to compare with observations of the Earthshine with the William Herschel Telescope (WHT) on May 18, 2013 (see [this paper](https://www.aanda.org/articles/aa/pdf/2014/02/aa23009-13.pdf) by Miles-Páez et. al.).

MODIS data acquired [here](https://ladsweb.modaps.eosdis.nasa.gov/search/).

ABSTRACT

The hunt for life as we know it outside of our solar system rests on the discovery of Earth-like exoplanets, which could be characterized by the presence of biosignatures in the atmosphere. Our knowledge of these biosignature signals naturally comes from what we see of our own atmosphere. We can make ground-based observations of Earth’s surface and atmosphere when solar light reflects from the Earth to the Moon and back to Earth - a phenomenon called earthshine. In this study, we compare earthshine data from the William Herschel Telescope (WHT) of the cloud and surface reflectance of Earth with homogeneous and inhomogeneous radiative transfer models of Earth. These models are obtained using data from the NASA MODIS mission on the date which the earthshine was observed. This comparison could inform the search for habitable exoplanets by showing us what potential signal from an Earth-like planet may look like, and thereby leading to improvements on our models of signals from other worlds.
